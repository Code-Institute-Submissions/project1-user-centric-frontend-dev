-from guidelines-
"Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfils. 
It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. 
Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, 
explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL."
